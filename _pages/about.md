I am an Associate Professor *(tenured)* of Political Science at the Department of Political Science at Aarhus University and a SNSF Ambizione Grant Holder at the University of Zurich. 

I primarily work on and teach *Comparative Politics*, *Political Behavior* and *Political Economy*. As a scientist, I seek to address research questions which are relevant to both the academic as well as the public debate. This means that I work on some of the key challenges contemporary democracies are facing such as the rise of extremism, its societal consequences, remedies to mitigate extremism, and the erosion of social norms more generally. My studies are primarily empirically oriented using research designs which seek to rigorously test theoretical arguments mostly with (quasi-)experimental designs. More information on the two major research projects I currently work on can be found below:

1.) **The Causes & Consequences of Extreme Party Entrance** (funded by SNSF Ambizione Grant: [www.extremeentrance.github.io](https://extremeentrance.github.io))

2.) **DEMNORM - Democratic Norms** (funded by Carlsberg Foundation Young Research Fellowship & AUFF Starting Grant: [www.demnorm.github.io](https://demnorm.github.io/))
