## Short Bio:

I am currently based in Seoul, South Korea where I have been working as an ISEF Research Fellow at the Environmental Planning Institute (EPI), Seoul National University (SNU). Before joining SNU, I worked as Assistant Professor, at National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST). I received Ph.D in Public Policy from the Korea Development Institute (KDI), School of Public Policy and Management under the Global Ambassador’s Scholarship Program.

## Short Research Overview:
I primarily use impact evaluation methods in experimental and quasi-experimental settings that helps policy analysts assess the effectiveness of government policies in an unbiased way. As a researcher, I seek to scientifically answer three important questions: a) Whether changes in the well-being of individuals are attributable to a particular project, program, or policy? b) what type of policies do governments need to improve the standard of life (including education, health and happiness) of common citizens? c) What is the best use of scientific knowledge for existing societies and generations to come?

My work is mainly empirically oriented using research designs that rigorously test theoretical arguments mostly in (quasi-)experimental contexts. For instance, during my doctoral research, I was able to find ideal conditions for a quasi-natural experiment in which I exploited a countrywide education survey to evaluate the impact of public schools’ monitoring system in the northwestern province of Pakistan. Alongside my co-advisors, we utilized a large-scale dataset to study various dimensions of governance through powerful research designs. My other dissertation paper empirically examined the effect of inclusive governance in protected areas on environmental outcomes. Recently, as a principal investigator, I have successfully completed a research project that focused on the impact evaluation of the land-record computerization in the Punjab province, Pakistan. In this project, we worked on developing a rigorous research design that included a convincing theory of change followed by primary data collection from the field.
