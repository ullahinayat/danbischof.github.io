  abstract={This paper examines the effect of a large-scale innovative monitoring program implemented in over 28000 government schools for improving teacher’s attendance and school performance in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province, Pakistan. In 2014, the government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province introduced the Independent Monitoring Project aiming at increasing teacher attendance in primary and secondary public schools across the province. We find ideal conditions for a natural experiment by utilizing an annually conducted independent and systematically random survey to compare schools and children’s performance in the treated region with their counterparts in  the controlled region that satisfies all conditions for a valid comparison. Our analysis is based on the difference-in-difference approach with district and village fixed models using pooled data from 2012 to 2018. 
Our findings suggest that the monitoring program has improved teacher’s attendance by nearly 8% in the year immediately following the program. However, this effect decreases by nearly half after two years of the program introduction. We also find the program’s direct effect on the enrolled children’s test performance at home. Enrolled children’s standardized Reading, Math and English ability in the monitored schools has improved significantly by 0.07, 0.13 and 0.11 standard deviations points respectively at the lower (0-5) grades. There is slight improvement in the standardized test performance of higher-grade children. The program also increases the probability of children enrollment into government schools. Our results are robust on different specifications and sub-samples of schools and districts clusters.
