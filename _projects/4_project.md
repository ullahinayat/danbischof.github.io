The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) developed by the United Nations (UN) in 2015 have
brought increased awareness to critical issues such as the environ ment, employment, and health.
These issues hold great significance, particularly for developing countries. Governments,
organizations, institutions, and policymakers worldwide have prioritized the SDGs and are actively
undertaking initiatives to support th e UN's Social Progress Index (SPI). In Pakistan, while the other
provinces participated in the afforestation project under the guidance of the Federal Government
in 2019, the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) had already initiated the "Billion Tree Tsunami
Afforestation Project (BTTAP)" in 2013. The KP government took this important step towards
addressing climate change by focusing on enhancing forest cover, conserving biodiversity, and
establishing protected areas within the province.
Under the KDIS Alumni Working Partner Program, we
evaluated the short term impact of BTTAP on
relevant employment and awareness, as well as the long term effects on health, environment,
pollution, internal migration, and animal habitats. Our evaluation involved collecting data from the
general pub lic, project stakeholders, and government officials. Additionally, we leverage the Pakistan
Social Living Standard Measurement (PSLM) data, which offers comprehensive modules related to
health and employment, as a valuable panel dataset.
Although the
evaluation of this project is in its early stages, we employ GIS mapping techniques to
identify treatment areas. Moreover, we utilize the difference in difference and instrumental variable
approaches with fixed effects using panel data to control f or time and group specific effects,
ensuring a rigorous analysis of the project's impact. We aim to provide valuable insights into the
effectiveness of the BTTAP in addressing environmental concerns, promoting employment, an d
improving the overall well being of communities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The findings of
our study contribute to the ongoing efforts towards achieving the SDGs and fostering sustainable
development in the region. [Final Report-Billion Tree Tsunami.pdf](https://github.com/ullahinayat/inayat.github.io/files/11799047/Final.Report-Billion.Tree.Tsunami.pdf)
